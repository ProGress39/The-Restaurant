<h2>What it is?</h2>
<p>It is my second project which I made for myself to learn some more css, bootstrap, animations etc. Just learning by writing simple site.
One page site for non-existing restaurant, based on my own idea.</p>
<h2>What I used here?</h2>
Here I wanted to improve my HTML&CSS skills so I didn't mess with JavaScript this time. Just a lil bit of it.
<br><h5>Tools I used here:</h5>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
<li>AOS Animation Library</li>
<li>GIT</li>
<li>Sass</li>
<li>jQuery (only one case)</li>
